/**
 * This class is a facade for the Java sound API. It was modified from the
 * Tritonus library to be play the sound multiple times without having to
 * reload the file. Thus, it is memory inefficient. It handles only WAV
 * formats.
 * See http://www.jsresources.org/examples/audio_playing_recording.html.
 * The file must have the following characteristics:
 * characteristics:<br>
 * Dynamic range: 16-bits<br>
 * Sample rate: 8K samples/s<br>
 * Channels: 1 (mono)<br>
 * For some samples I also normalized the audio
 * (see http://www.learndigitalaudio.com/blog/normalize-audio) although
 * I don't see how this is necessary.<br>
 * In any case, see http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav
 * convert to WAV format.

         First, we have to say which kind of line we want. The

         (for repeated playback)	and TargetDataLine (for
         recording).
         Here, we want to do normal playback, so we ask for
         a SourceDataLine.
         Then, we have to pass an AudioFormat object, so that
         the Line knows which format the data passed to it
         will have.
         Furthermore, we can give Java Sound a hint about how
         big the internal buffer for the line should be. This
         isn't used here, signaling that we
         don't care about the exact size. Java Sound will use
         some default value for the buffer size.
