# BlackJackGame using JAVA (CHARLIE)
- This game is the modified version of repo 'Charlie' - https://github.com/roncoleman125/charlie2.git which was coded by Dr. Ronn Coleman, Marist College.

# Note
### log4j directory location changed 
- right now: LOGDIR = E:\\kevDev\\ProjectWorks\\BlackJackGame\\Java\\Charlie\\tmp
- to have different directory, just change this one on log4j.properties and then clean & build it.
