Tasks
Part I - Answer these questions.
  1. Using the Wizard of Odds, what are the odds?
     - The Wizard of Odds gives the exact probability,p as 0.00302
     - odds = ( 1 - P ) / P, so odds => odds = ((1-0.00302)/0.0302) = 321.13
     - The odds using the wizard of odds is 321.13
     
  2. Is the Royal Match a fair bet?
     - No. because they are paying by the odds of 10:1 instead of 321.13:1
     
  3. If yes, why? If no, why not and what is appropriate payout for a $5 using the Wizard of Odds?
     - for the odds of 321:1, (5 * 321) = $1,605.65 is the actual payout for $5 using the wizard of Odds. But they are paying in odds of 10:1 by paying $50 instead of $1,605

  4. If you estimate the probability to the accuracy of the Wizard of Odds except using Monte Carlo simulation, what’s the minimum number of games you will need to play?
     - Probablity, P of Wizard of Odds => P = 4/52 * (1 - 1/51) * (1/ 50) * 2 = 0.00302
     - Probablity, P of Monte Carlo simulation of odds => P=(1/sqrt(N))
     - equating, 0.00302 = (1/sqrt(N))
     - so, N = (1/ (0.00302)^2) = 109,644.31 

  5. If you wanted to get an extra digit of accuracy, how many simulations would you need to run? Write your answer in the assignment shell
     - The more the number of samples being ran, the more accurate the extra digit would be. So, to get an extra next digit of accuracy, you  have to run (100,000 * 100,000) times

Part II - Estimate the Super 7 odds using Monte Carlo simulation.
  d. If Super 7 pays 3:1, is it a fair bet?
     - No, its not fair since the actual resopnse for Super 7 odds is 12:1

Part III - Estimate the Royal Match odds using Monte Carlo simulation.

  d. Assuming the Wizard of Odds is correct, do the combinatorial and Monte Carlo approaches look accurate?
     - Yes

  e. How can you improve the Monte Carlo estimate? Try it. What result do you get?
     - Change the number of simulations to 109,644 to improve the Monte Carlo Simulation
