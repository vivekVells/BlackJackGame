Kindly review the answer to the Lab 5 questions: Part - I - Validation Design

However, a well-behaved advisor tests these assumptions. There are several exceptional conditions
advisor needs to validate.
Can you think of five (5) of them?
1. myHand being null
2. myHand value greater than or equal to 21
3. upCard being null
4. upCard value greater than or equal to 21
5.

What are two reasonable things advisor can do when it encounters these exceptions? (Hint: one of them is NOT to throw the exception)
1. using null check
2. using value check

Handled 1,2,3 and 4 above using the following code:

if(myHand == null) {
    System.out.println("myHand value is null!");
    play = Play.NONE;
}else if(myHand.getValue() >= 21){
    System.out.println("myHand value should be less than 21");
    play = Play.NONE;
}else if(upCard == null) {
    System.out.println("upcard value is null!");
    play = Play.NONE;
}else if(upCard.value() >= 21){
    System.out.println("upcard value should be less than 21");
    play = Play.NONE;
}
